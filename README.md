# ML-Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based skin rash identification system that classifies three common skin conditions: Eczema, Dermatitis, and Ringworm. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze rash images and predict the type of rash along with its symptoms and precautions.
